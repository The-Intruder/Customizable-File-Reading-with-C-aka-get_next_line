One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself trans
formed in his bed into a horrible vermin. He lay on his armour-like back, and if
 he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and di
vided by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to cover it and
 seemed ready to slide off any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin compared wi
th the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked. "What's hap
pened to me?" he thought. It wasn't a dream. His room, a proper human room altho
ugh a little too small, lay peacefully between its four familiar walls. A collec
tion of textile samples lay spread out on the table - Samsa was a travelling sal
esman - and above it there hung a picture that he had recently cut out of an ill
ustrated magazine and housed in a nice, gilded frame. It showed a lady fitted ou
t with a fur hat and fur boa who sat upright, raising a heavy fur muff that cove
red the whole of her lower arm towards the viewer. Gregor then turned to look ou
t the window at the dull weather.
